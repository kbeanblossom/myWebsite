                    <p>That's right, you heard it! Kyle is making a test website, and we couldn't be happier. He is testing his HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills to see what he knows and what he can do!</p>

                    <h2>Site improving!</h2>
                    <p>Kyle is getting better at this whole website making thing! He is working more with CSS to make the website's look improve a bit. Now, even though things are looking better, it's surely not professional, and it probably never will be, but it's still not bad for an amateur!</p>
